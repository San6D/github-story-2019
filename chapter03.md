# Alternative Ending
## The Injury

Week by week the team turns up in its numbers to train through all weather conditions, except snow, we draw the line there! It could be raining and still go out and work on ourselves as individual and as a team.

During one of those training sessions, everything changed and not in a good way.

We were doing our running drills as normal, felt a little twinge in the ankle after rolling it while turning at a cone.  Was hopeful that it would just go away after a few mins of trying to "walk it off" as they say.

Next up was the ball work and everything felt fine, just a little bit of tenderness when coming into contact with the ball but other than that no real reason to worry.  Or so I thought!

We moved on to the match.  It was quite competitive but friendly in spirit.  Tempo was set high.  We are in pre-season after all and need to work towards the _EndGame_ of the upcoming season.

I went into a 50/50 to clear the ball.  My standing foot, which was sore foot, did not like it at all and without any force it just gave a rip like a zip noise and totally gave way.  First the foot went into spasm, next came the shock, then came the delayed pain...  Pure agony.

This was a sign that something awful had happened and it wasn't just a normal swollen ankle.  It was more than likely ligament damage from the signs - noise and pain level.

Unfortunately worst fears were realised over next few days.  Ankle swollen like a balloon.  It was bruised with all sorts of colors.  Physio appointment confirmed torn ligaments.

So that was that....   Season over before it even got started, well for the next 10 weeks.  No _EndGame_ anymore.  Just a lot of pain and suffering and rehabilitation.
