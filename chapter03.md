# The EndGame


Week by week the team turns up in its numbers to train through all weather conditions, except snow, we draw the line there! It could be raining and still go out and work on ourselves as individual and as a team.

The show of strength and support for each other through the tough and gruelling training sessions becomes more evident as the weeks go by.  Players communicating positively towards each other, encouraging those who are struggling to keep up, praising those who are doing well.  It is great to see as it bonds the team closer and closer.

The earlier weeks would have started with more fitness work, the later weeks would have moved on to football work and drills.  Each with the _EndGame_ in mind - the upcoming season.  With all the work done, the next step is succeed as a team in the league.

With the first league game looming, all players are getting excited and are optimistic about what is to come.  The dynamics of the team have been ironed out.  What players play where.  What formations the team can play.  What the aim and goal is for the team - play well and win as a united front!
