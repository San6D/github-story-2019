# Start of Pre-Season Training

The dreaded words: Start of Pre-Season Training


It is only a word, a joint word and it is not a big word...... but it is a word that has the same meaning but brings different feelings to a lot of people. Some look forward to it and see it as the start of the upcoming season. The getting back together of a team. Others fear it... They see it as running, running and more running.!! Hard training sessions ahead. What it does mean is that there will be a lot of hard work, sweat and possible tears for some...!

Winter has come and gone. Spring is starting, the weather changing and the days getting somewhat brighter. There is a change in the air around the team as we know summer will be upon us soon. The phones starts to buzz with manager requests to see who is available for the season. Everyone checking with anticipation to see who will be there, who won't be there, what type of season we might have to look forward to.... and the one key piece of information: what date are we due back for pre-season!!

So let the players come back in, ready to go and let the hard work begin!!
