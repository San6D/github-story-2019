# Hard Work


Player by player, they all trudge in for _day one_ of pre-season training.  There are a lot of apprehensive smiles, players are glad to be back but nervous of the hard work that is to come in the sessions!

All the players meet and greet each other as it has been a while since some have met up.  Some took the winter off, while others stayed involved with the club and soccer.  They would play 5 a side astro in small cage to keep active and playing.  A non-competitive game with team-mates!

There are an abundance of cones laid out in the training area.  Cones of varies sizes and shapes.  Cones in straight or diagonal lines.  The footballs are nowhere in plain sight, a lot of worried faces when the players notice this.  Thankfully someone spots them in the corner still to be taken out of the gear bag.

Week by week players are brought through structured pre-season training sessions two nights a week.  Nice easy warm up followed by running with and without the ball.  Just before the final showdown of the training session the squad is broken into teams for small sided games.

Then comes the strength and conditioning work to finish off each session.  Hard work on the muscles.  Build and strengthen them up.  It not easy work.  It not enjoyable work.  But all participate willingly as they know this is in their interest to do, even if it means pain especially the next day!! _No Pain No Gain_!!
